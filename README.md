# 2019 Staff Diversity
Measuring diversity within the Columbia Daily Spectator and comparing staff diversity against other sections and top college newspapers. 

**Note:** This will be the Columbia Daily Spectator's first Staff Diversity Report. This report will provide conclusive data on where the organization can improve in its diversity. Diversity will be measured in several ways (ethnic, socioeconomic, etc). This publication may also set a precedent for other campus organizations and college newspapers to follow in increasing transparency and committing to the development of more inclusive environments.

## Guiding Question(s)
* As of Spring 2019, how diverse is the Columbia Daily Spectator staff? 
* Where can the Columbia Daily Spectator do better to create a more inclusive environment?
* How does the Columbia Daily Spectator's staff diversity fare against other top college newspapers'? *This depends on whether such data is retrievable or a data set can be created!*

## TODOs

Narrow down.
* Analyze the data at broad and specific comparison levels (entire staff, Journalism, B&I, Board/Leadership, Associate-Trainee).
* Is staff diversity skewed in certain fields?
* What are the specific data fields worth discussing? Eliminate non-essential data.

Compare.
* Compare field counts at various levels.
* CDS staff diversity to other college newspaper.
* Determine if any correlation between fields and different levels of comparison exists.
